# Samples

The following are samples to see how [Material](http://cosmicmind.com/material), [Graph](http://cosmicmind.com/graph), and [Algorithm](http://cosmicmind.com/algorithm) may be used within your applications.

* Visit the [Samples](https://github.com/CosmicMind/Samples) project to see example projects using Graph.

## Creating an Entity for an ImageCard

In the following example, we create an ImageCard view using Material and populate it's properties with a Graph Entity that stores the data for that view.

## Searching a list of users in realtime

Using the **Graph Search** API is incredibly flexible. In the following example, Search is used to create a live search on user names with a dynamic UI provided by [Material's SearchBar](http://cosmicmind.com/material/searchbar).
